# Coding+Robotics
Let's use GitHub to build test files for the Coding+Robotics Camp's Robotics Unit.

We should focus on the Finch Robots and the different environments/languages it's compatible with.  Depending on the age group, we should then pick a corresponding language that's suited for them.

Finch Environment (beginners - young kids)

Scratch (intermediate - teens )

Java (advanced - older teens)

C++/Objective C (very advanced - returning teens?)
